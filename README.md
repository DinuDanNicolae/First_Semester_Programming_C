Problem 1 - The implementation of this problem took approximately 4 hours. 
The program stores the vector of pairs of words in a heterogeneous data structure, which has fields for the first word, the second word, and the degree of the pair. 
The program uses 5 functions to determine if two strings of characters are anagrams, to calculate the score of a pair of anagrams, to sort the vector of pairs by degree, to sort pairs of the same degree in decreasing lexicographical order, and to swap the values of two pairs.

Problem 2 - The implementation of this problem took 5 hours. 
The program stores the coordinates on the chessboard of each bishop, as well as whether it has a pair or not, in a heterogeneous data structure. 
The program uses functions to search for the pairs of a bishop and to check possible moves of bishops that have a pair.

Problem 4 - The implementation of this problem took 6 hours. 
The program generates the initial matrix using a function that converts a given number to binary and stores it as a string of characters. 
Then, the program calculates the transpose of the initial matrix using a function for this purpose. 
Using a function that multiplies two matrices according to Boolean logic, the program calculates the metric square of the initial matrix, as well as the product between it and its transpose. 
With the help of a function that calculates the score of a matrix according to specified rules, the application decides which matrix has the highest score, which is subsequently displayed in decimal form.
